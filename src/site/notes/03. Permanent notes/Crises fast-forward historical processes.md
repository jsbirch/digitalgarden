# Crises fast-forward historical processes

This is either because they fundamentally change the economic and social system in and of themselves, or because policy decisions made in response to the crisis get "stuck" - they are not reversed.

Examples:
- [[World War Two|World War Two]] led to the development of the UK welfare state and a general change in the role of the state, increasing gender equality and the breaking down of previous societal norms (around sex, drugs etc).
- [[2008 Financial Crisis|2008 Financial Crisis]] led to the rise of populism
