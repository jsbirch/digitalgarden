# How to Focus

- our brains are suited to 90 minute cycles - it's probably not best to try and focus on deep work for a longer period
- Aim at first for only 1-2 deep work periods per day
- You can try your focus capacity by practicing it - our brains are highly plastic. Doesn't only have to be work based - at the weekends you should also try and do the same by focusing on a book or learning something specific without distraction. 
- After a bout of focus, try to defocus consciously with low effort tasks. Let your brain idle to recharge - don't use phone as you go to the bathroom etc. Treat it as equivalent to a rest period from a weights set. 
	- Do things that are automatic or reflexive, nothing that means your eyes focus narrowly in a specific area
- Binaural beats of 40hz can be helpful for getting in the zone
- Delaying ingestion of caffeine for 90-120 mins after waking can improve the effects and prevent a precipitous drop in the afternoon. Waking naturally (getting overhead light soon after waking, using cold showers) allows the clear out of adenosine much better. 
- Cold water exposure:
	- There was an ancient practice of submerging people in ice water after they learnt something, with the intention that they would retain the knowledge better
	- Aim for uncomfortably cold but sustainable for a short period
	- up to your neck in a bath is best, cold shower is ok
